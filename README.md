StoreDown is a Progressive Web App(PWA) designed to help you put stuff away and find it again.
Due to the way StoreDown was built it can also be a forms application fronting CouchDB.(Like a very simple alternative of Microsoft Access)

I personally use StoreDown every day to keep track of 1,359 items <sup> at time of writing</sup>. Those items range from: a 90 pack of dental floss picks, a Jig saw, a refrigerator, to red 15W USB A to USB C cable(of which I have 6). If having this capability appeals to you, come along and enjoy the fun!
